Debian 10 \u00b6 Caution The NetCDF format is currently not supported on the Linux platform due to unresolved bug causing segmentation fault. Run as superuser: apt-get install libnetcdf-dev ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnetcdf.so /usr/lib/libnetcdf.so.7 Usage \u00b6 Encoding \u00b6 pmc encode --src input_file --bonds input_bonds_file --dst output_file --qr 0.01 --qa 0.1 --qc 0.001 Decoding \u00b6 pmc decode --src input_file --bonds input_bonds_file --dst output_file Supported bond formats \u00b6 Text files (.txt) \u00b6 Each line of the file contains list of integers separated by blank space and represents all the bonds incident with corresponding atom. For example, content of the bond file for single molecule of water could be as follows: 1 2 0 0 Gromacs format (.gro) \u00b6 Currently, this format can be used only for protein structures. Supported trajectory data formats \u00b6 Text files (.txt) \u00b6 Each line of the file contains list of single precision floating point numbers separated by blank space and represents positions of corresponding atom in each frame. For example, trajectory consisting of two atoms (A and B) in three frames should be as follows: xA1 yA1 zA1 xA2 yA2 zA2 xA3 yA3 zA3 xB1 yB1 zB1 xB2 yB2 zB2 xB3 yB3 zB3 Binary files \u00b6 Such file consists of single 32-bit signed integer value containing number of coordinates per atom in file, i.e. 3 * number of frames , folowed by 3 * number of atoms * number of frames 32-bit floating point values. For the above example text file, the data would look followingly: <9><xA1><yA1><zA1><xA2><yA2><zA2><xA3><yA3><zA3><xB1><yB1><zB1><xB2><yB2><zB2><xB3><yB3><zB3> Amber NetCDF format (.nc) \u00b6 Caution The NetCDF format is currently not supported on the Linux platform due to unresolved bug causing segmentation fault.","title":"Command line tool"},{"location":"bin/#command-line-tool","text":"The tool is available to download from https://xxx.yyy","title":"Command line tool"},{"location":"bin/#system-requirements","text":"The application was tested on 64-bit versions of Windows 10 (version 1909) and Debian 10.
